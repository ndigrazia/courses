Useful Resources

In this course, we will be going in depth on some of the core serverless services, but not all. Go through the documentation of the services that are not covered in this course to understand their purpose. You may not need to go through the entire documentation and API reference, but overview and concept sections of each documentation can help you understand if the service meets your need.
